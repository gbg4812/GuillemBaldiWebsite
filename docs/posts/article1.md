# The purpose of this website

## As a notebook for me

I'm frequently learning new things (it's like an addiction), but I often forget to take notes and
the new knowledge slips from my mind. So this website will be a place for me to write down the
things I learn and I want to keep in mind.

## As a way of sharing

It is important for me to share the answers to the questions that have made me bang my head against
the wall as well as the findings that excite me and keep me motivated.
