  - title: VFX
    details:
      Before starting my B.E. in CS I wanted to be a VFX artist (I liked technical work like
      simulations and procedural modeling), so I spent a year learning the tools and techniques but
      in the end i realized that my passion was in building the tools.
  - title: Music and Dance

      I have conservatory studies in flute and I have learned to like "classical" music a lot. Also,
      I have been dancing from the age of 5 in my city "esbart" (An "esbart" is a traditional dance
      center, mine explores the modernitzation of tradition ).
